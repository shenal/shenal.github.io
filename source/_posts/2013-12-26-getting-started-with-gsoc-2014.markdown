###GSoC
I didnt know about GSoC until I was halfway through my first year. It was only after reading Ramidu ayya blog which made me realise that anyone can work for google (even though indirectly). Then upon reading a few more articles on the web I got to know the details of the Summer of Code program. 
I wasn't following a particular open source project back in early 2013, therefore couldnt do anything for the 9th GSoC.I was determined after a few people that I know got their projects accepted and i was happy for them.

Work for GSoC 2014 started back in September, with an initative of a few past participants in our university to mentor to be candidates of the program. I too was assigned a mentor, and its been of great help.

Hoping to make a big impact this time.
Cheers!
