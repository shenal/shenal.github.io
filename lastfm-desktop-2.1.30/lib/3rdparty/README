Windows
=======

You need to install:
* mad
* fftw3 (single precision)
* libsamplerate
* taglib

The fetch.sh will attempt to fetch and build them all. But you need to use
MinGW in order to compile fftw and libsamplerate.

We have binaries at /svn/clientside/bin/win.
Minimal headers are also in lib/3rdparty, though we don't keep these up to date.


Mac OS X
========
Use macports to install:

* taglib
* fftw3-3
* libsamplerate
* taglib

Linux
=====
Install the same as for the Mac with your package manager.
