Twiddly is coupled to the iPod handling component of the iTunes plugin and the
Last.fm Client software.

It is launched when an iPod has finished syncing with iTunes and compares the
iTunesPlaysDatabase with the iTunes Library Database, and thus determines what
has been played by an iPod.

It is a separate process for the purpose of writing simpler code, and the
use-case where the client is not running.
